        <h2>Project Summary</h2>
        <p>For this engineering design project, I collaborated with a teammate to design and fabricate a two-degree-of-freedom electromechanical system capable of positioning a laser pointer to create optical animations. Our specific responsibility was the mechanical design, which included construction of the custom DC actuators and the gimbal assembly. The project requirement was building two brushed, permanent magnet DC motors from scratch.</p>

        <h2>Mechanical &amp; Motor Design</h2>
        <p>The core of the build involved designing two distinct motors: a high-torque "Yaw" motor and a lightweight "Pitch" motor. For the Yaw motor, we utilized steel laminations stacked helically with a 20-degree offset. This specific geometry was chosen to minimize cogging torque while maximizing magnetic flux. We employed a lap winding technique for the armature to create parallel current paths, ensuring even distribution and preventing mechanical imbalance during rotation. The enclosures were 3D printed with tight tolerances, featuring a curved slotting structure to minimize the air gap between the magnets and rotor to just 2mm.</p>

        <h2>Commutation &amp; Power Transmission</h2>
        <p>One of the most challenging aspects was the commutation system. We fabricated a custom disk commutator using copper segments secured to a 3D-printed platform. To handle the heat generated by sparking, we insulated the commutator from the shaft using a nylon tube with a high melting point (265°C). For the brushes, we engineered a solution using soft copper braid soldered to springs, which reduced friction while maintaining consistent electrical contact. A unique feature of our design was the "sliding lid" mechanism on the enclosure, which allowed us to mechanically adjust the brush position to optimize timing for bidirectional rotation.</p>

        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>Despite challenges with brush friction and reliability, the final assembly successfully met the control requirements. The system was capable of drawing stable shapes, such as a circle, at a frequency of 10Hz, validating the mechanical robustness of our custom motor and gimbal hardware.</p>
